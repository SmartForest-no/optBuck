# Apter development plan

Updated 2026-10-15. Replaces the previous PLAN.md and supersedes docs/plans/phase0.md (and any other files in docs/plans/). Detailed conventions live in CLAUDE.md; developer details, audits and benchmarks in docs/development.md.

Working rules: one phase per session, plan mode first, show the plan to Lennart before editing, work on a branch off main, re-run all audits at the end of a phase, and don't merge or push until Lennart says so. Never edit `scripts/prototype_reference/` or `audits/prototype_reference/`. When a convention is undecided, follow optBuck (SmartForest-no/optBuck) unless it conflicts with a decision in this file or CLAUDE.md.

## Scope

- Apter is a general bucking simulator for Norway spruce and Scots pine, for industry partners: compare and improve price matrices and plan bucking. It is not an inventory or estimation tool, and NFI is not emphasised.
- Tree sources: NFI data (all plots of a stratum), uploaded tree lists, and (Phase 6) uploaded stem profiles. Results describe the selected trees only. No per-ha, plot-level or stratum outputs.
- Values are NOK per m³ of commercial solid volume under bark (definition in CLAUDE.md).
- Deployment: NIBIO Linux server with many cores; testing on Lennart's remote desktop.

## Done

| Phase | Content |
|---|---|
| 0 | Housekeeping: root resolution, app split, smoke audit (17) |
| 1 | Rename nfiBuck → Apter; partner-facing README |
| 2 | Appearance (bslib, reactable, self-hosted fonts) |
| 3 | Under-bark diameters (barkNOR, B ≥ 0 floor), NOK/m³ denominator, shared solid-volume rule |
| 4a | Deterministic tie-breaking; price-matrix editor; comparison with cutting-pattern changes |
| 4b | Custom assortments; per-product volume methods (StanForD, Norwegian mid per Målereglement 2026); per-product price cap |
| 5 | Tree-list import; height imputation (fieldPlot, calibrated/uncalibrated FinnHoyde) |
| Performance | Shared candidate pass, vectorisation, parallel workers, ExtendedTask; `or_default()` |
| 4c | Interface redesign: two tabs, one assortment table, price sets A and B, default diameter limits from optBuck, Forest & sand look |
| 4d | Scenarios A and B with their own assortments and prices; simpler assortments; optBuck name in the app; all NFI plots; paged result tables; demo files |

## Phase 4d: scenarios and polish (done, 2026-10-15)

Built on branch `scenarios-and-polish` after Phase 4c was merged. Results are identical to main except that NFI runs use all plots, and comparisons can use B's own assortments.

1. **Scenarios A and B** cover assortments as well as prices. The Assortments and prices tab has two columns, Scenario A on the left and Scenario B on the right, which stack on narrow screens. Each column has a compact assortment table (Assortment, Species, Top Ø, Max butt Ø, Length, Volume method) with Add/Edit/Remove, and that scenario's price matrices below it.
   - The scenarios are independent (revised before merging): B starts as an exact copy of A, both sides are always editable, and nothing is greyed or linked. Differences are highlighted on both sides.
   - "Make B equal to A" (right column) and "Make A equal to B" (left column) work for the whole scenario and per assortment (Assortments section), and for all prices and per matrix (Price matrices section).
   - An assortment can be added to both scenarios or one, and removed from one scenario or both. Its price type (matrix or flat) is set per scenario. The matrix selectors are independent.
   - No status notes. A comparison runs when A and B differ in assortments or prices. NOK/m³ per scenario uses that scenario's own commercial volume.
   - Each scenario has an xlsx upload and download (assortments plus price sheets), and price matrices load separately as before.
2. **Simpler assortments.** No Type field: the product type stays hidden, base waste rows stay waste when renamed, and user-added assortments are always commercial. No Length step: flat-priced assortments use 10 cm steps, and matrix-priced ones take their lengths from the matrix columns. No Diameter rounding: it is fixed per volume method. The defaults give identical products. The dialog has no blurred backdrop.
3. **Text.** The app shows "optBuck" (title, navbar, browser tab); the code and repository keep the name Apter. "2021" and "(wide or long)" are gone. "NFI sample" became "NFI data". The price reset button is "Reset prices".
4. **Data and speed.**
   - NFI runs use every plot of the stratum. The backend's `all_plots`; before this phase the backend capped runs at 50 plots although the app asked for 200.
   - Above 30,000 trees, a note under Run gives the tree count and an estimated run time.
   - The progress bar shows as soon as Run is clicked and covers loading, taperNOR, bucking and the summary.
   - The Per m³ tab was slow because the Trees table built every tree's log table at render time. Trees, Selected logs and changed trees are now paged on the server, with a CSV download of all rows, and a tree's logs render when the tree is selected.
5. **Results tables.** Columns are sized to their content, and headers are readable and wrap. The Products tab has one Assortment column; after a comparison it shows grouped Scenario A / Scenario B charts. Selected logs has no ProductType and shows Plot, with StartPos and StopPos as they are.
6. **Demo files** in `demo/`, from `scripts/make_demo_files.R`: both scenarios, both price files, and an example tree list.
7. **Audits.** New audit 24 covers scenarios and the demo files. Audits 17 and 23 were updated.
8. **Run time.** NFI taper profiles always come from the precomputed cache; taperNOR never runs for NFI trees. The ~2 min default-stratum comparison was mostly the per-tree cutting-pattern comparison (62 s). It is vectorised now (0.8 s, identical output); the bucking itself takes about 34 s on 15 workers.

## Phase 6: stem profile import

- Long format (CSV or xlsx): `tree_id`, `species` (spruce/pine), `height` (m along the stem), `diameter` (cm, over bark), optional `plot_id`. Downloadable template. Reading StanForD .hpr files is out of scope.
- Profiles are over bark. Under-bark diameters with barkNOR (B ≥ 0 floor); dbh is read from the profile at 1.3 m.
- Interpolate to the 10 cm grid and feed the profiles straight into candidate generation, bypassing taperNOR.
- Non-monotonic profiles are valid: no warnings or errors for local diameter increases.
- Validation: errors for missing columns, non-numeric values, missing IDs, unknown species, non-positive values, duplicated heights within a tree. Warnings for likely unit errors (state the suspected unit; never convert silently), profiles with very few points or large height gaps, and profiles that don't reach 1.3 m.

## Later and open items

- **Sensitivity tool** (undecided): show how cutting patterns and NOK/m³ respond to ±x % changes in a price cell or assortment. A price-matrix optimiser would need an explicit objective (e.g. target volume shares), to be defined by Lennart first.
- **Negative pine bark in barkNOR:** the B ≥ 0 floor is provisional; ask the taperNOR authors whether the pine behaviour near the top is intended and whether Hansen et al. (2023) refitted the coefficients.
- **fieldPlot fixes** (Lennart's package, separate session): loop over species present; error handling around the fitHD() fallback; a working timeout; species curve for plots without heights; nlme:: calls; README install URL. Apter's wrapper works around these meanwhile.
- **Deployment** on the NIBIO server: set apter.workers so that R processes × workers ≤ cores.
