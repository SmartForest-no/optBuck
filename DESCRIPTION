Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lennart Noordermeer
Maintainer: Lennart Noordermeer <lennart.noordermeer@nmbu.no>
Description: This package contains functions for extracting and analyzing data from cut-to-length harvesters and optimizing the bucking. It uses harvester production report (.hpr) files as input. The main function is optBuck() which optimizes the bucking of tree stems using dynamic programming. The package is based on harvester production data retrieved from cut-to-length harvesters in the StanFord data format. Therefore, input data, units, variable names, and parameters follow this format. In case of the input data not originating from .hpr files, but for example from .pri files or field data, a set of taper functions are provided to transform the input data into the required format.
